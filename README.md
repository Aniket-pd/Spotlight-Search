# Spotlight for Chrome

A Spotlight-style universal search and launcher for Chrome that runs entirely locally. Invoke the overlay with `Cmd+K` (macOS) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) to instantly search across open tabs, bookmarks, and recent history.

## Features
- Fast in-memory index covering tabs, bookmarks, and up to 500 history entries.
- Weighted scoring with support for exact, prefix, and fuzzy matches (edit distance ≤ 1).
- Arrow-key navigation, Enter to open, and Esc/click outside to dismiss.
- Optional `Alt+Space` shortcut.
- Command `> reindex` to rebuild the local search index on demand.
- All processing performed locally—no network calls.

## Loading the Extension
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome.
3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top right.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the repository directory.
5. Use the keyboard shortcut (`Cmd+K`/`Ctrl+K`) on any page to open Spotlight.

## Development Notes
- Background indexing runs on startup and whenever tabs/bookmarks/history change.
- The overlay UI lives in `content.js` with styles from `styles.css`.
- Indexing and search logic reside in `indexer.js` and `search.js` respectively.

Enjoy lightning-fast, private browsing search!
